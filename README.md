# Welcome!


Hello awesome human being(or..alien?) and thank you for taking the time to view my repos!
As you can see, most of my projects are coming from my classes here at SAIT.
Thatâ€™s because I am still a student and I am learning lots of things! I am loving this course so far and there are so many things I want to learn. I will be coming back to clean up my code after this program and see what else I can do to make my projects better.


### The Project

This project showcases most of the things I learned from my JavaScript Class! The goal of the project is to create a website for a travel agency in ONE day. The purpose was to give us an experience of finishing a project in a tight schedule.

###### My Solution + Process
Because of the tight schedule, I re-used one of my projects' structure for this one. I made it as simple as possible and made sure it is welcoming. 

###### Tools + Techniques
```
* Vanilla Javascript
* jQuery
* Mobile Menu
* Animations + transitions
* Forms
* Bootstrap
* Flexbox
```

### In conclusion
As this is a WIP, I would like to clean up my code more and make it responsive as well. I'd like to add more to the visuals and make it look more about travelling.

I will also be connecting my forms to a server where I can retrieve the data put in.
